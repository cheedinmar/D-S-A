/**
 * Design Patterns
In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

Creational Design Patterns
These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

Abstract Factory
Builder
Factory
Prototype
Singleton

Abstract Factory
It defines an interface for creating a single object and lets child classes decide which class to instantiate.
